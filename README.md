# CSE 160: Introduction to Parallel Computing Assignment 4

Project Overview: The goal of this assignment is to parallelize the serial code similar to the one used in PR2 using pthreads instead of MPI, using row-wise decomposition. It is a simple iteration to solve the final temperature distribution on a plate using so-called Dirichlet (fixed temperature) boundary conditions
